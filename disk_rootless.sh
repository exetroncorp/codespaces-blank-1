# === AUTOMATED INSTALLATION VIA QEMU + EXPECT ===
# This Expect script launches QEMU (without -enable-kvm, so purely in software)
# with the disk image attached as a virtio drive and the Alpine ISO as CDROM.
# It connects the serial port to stdio (-serial stdio -nographic)
# and then sends keystrokes to the guestâ€™s console to run setup-alpine
# and answer its prompts automatically.
#
# The expected conversation is roughly:
#   1. At the login prompt, type "root" (Alpine ISO normally logs you in as root with no password).
#   2. At the shell prompt, type "setup-alpine" and then simulate answers:
#      - Accept default hostname (press Enter)
#      - Accept default keyboard (Enter)
#      - Accept default network interface (Enter)
#      - For IP config, type "dhcp" (Enter)
#      - For root password, type "vagrant" twice (Enter each time)
#      - For timezone, type "UTC" (Enter)
#      - For mirror, press Enter (accept default)
#      - For disk selection, type "vda" (Enter)
#      - For installation mode, type "sys" (Enter)
#      - For bootloader install, type "y" (Enter)
#
# (The actual prompts and timing may vary with Alpine versions; you might need
# to tweak the expect patterns or delays.)
